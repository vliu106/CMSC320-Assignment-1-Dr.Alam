Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: Git is a useful and good way to back-up code so that projects are not 
local on one machine. By storing it on the web, your projects are accessible
at any point in time, regardless of the state of one's computer. In addition, git 
also makes it easier to collaborate with others and to share one's projects to the public.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science could be used for ecology. For example, often times wildlife ecologists
set up cameras around certain areas to observe animal activities. These camera are often
equipped with motion sensors, so every time the camera senses movement it will take a 
series of consecutive shots. As a result, when ecologist arrive to pick up the cameras
and process them, they have to manually label and sift through thousands of photos of 
plant movement vs. animal movement. Afterwards, they import these photo labels 
into a spreadsheet, and use data science techniques to analyze and create data visualizations
of the behaviors and characteristics of local animals in the area.
