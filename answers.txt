Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: Git is a useful and good way to back-up code so that projects are not 
local on one machine. By storing it on the web, your projects are accessible
at any point in time, regardless of the state of one's computer. In addition, git 
also makes it easier to collaborate with others and to share one's projects to the public.
